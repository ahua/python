To create a patch:

{{{
svn checkout http://trash-cli.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ trash-cli
cd trash-cli/
vim some files ...

# Run tests
python setup.py develop -s scripts
python setup.py test

# Add you as contributor
vim THANKS 

svn diff > some-name-that-describe-changes.patch
}}}

Then you can send it to trash-cli@andreafrancia.it or you can attach to an 
open issue.
